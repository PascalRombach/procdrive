# procdrive
Procdrive is a procedural wrapper around 
[`py-easydrive`](https://github.com/PascalRombach/py-easydrive)
which is itself a wrapper around [`py-drivesdk`](https://github.com/HHG-TecLap/py-drivesdk).

This library was developed to provide a practical environment for learning Python.
Procdrive aims to be simple and intuitive and a transition into more complicated language constructs
such as object orientation and exception handling.

## Limitations
Since Procdrive is not object-oriented, it does not provide support 
for controlling multiple vehicles at the same time.
If you require this functionality you should check out the other libraries mentioned above.
